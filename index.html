        <h2>Janalisa Waugh
            I am interested in Web Development because while I am not entirely sure which specific computer science career I will choose to pursue, I believe that developing as many computing skills as I can will make me a valuable candidate for any position I wish to acquire. I also find it interesting to learn about how the webpages I use so frequently are built.
        </h2>
        <p>I am Janalisa Waugh. I am a 19 year old second year Computer Science major at the University of the West Indies. I enjoy reading, cooking and critiquing films and television series. I like cookies, sleeping and Doctor Who. I hope to pursue a career in Software Engineering or another computer science career that involves coding.</p>
